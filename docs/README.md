### Some specifications in the front matter
- `single_col_layout`: (true or false), specifies the page layout. The Home page has `single_col_layout: true`. The default is false (not defined in the front matter at all)
- `logo`: (url or empty), specifies the post logo image path. If it has an external url, use the url. The default is empty (not defined in the front matter at all)


### Some spefifications in the file format
- We always use `png` as the logo image.
- We always use `png` as the content image and `gif` as the content animation.
- The bio image can be any format because it is specified separately.
