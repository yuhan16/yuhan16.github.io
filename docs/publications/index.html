            Guided cooperation is a common task in many multi-agent teaming applications. 
            The planning of the cooperation is difficult when the leader robot has incomplete information about the follower, and there is a need to learn, customize, and adapt the cooperation plan online. 
            To this end, we develop a learning-based Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to address this challenge to achieve optimal trajectory planning for heterogeneous robots. 
            We first formulate the guided trajectory planning problem as a dynamic Stackelberg game and design the cooperation plans using open-loop Stackelberg equilibria. 
            We leverage meta-learning to deal with the unknown follower in the game and propose a Stackelberg meta-learning framework to create online adaptive trajectory guidance plans, 
            where the leader robot learns a meta-best-response model from a prescribed set of followers offline and then fast adapts to a specific online trajectory guidance task using limited learning data. 
            We use simulations in three different scenarios to elaborate on the effectiveness of our framework. 
            Comparison with other learning approaches and no guidance cases show that our framework provides a more time- and data-efficient planning method in trajectory guidance tasks.

            Guided cooperation allows intelligent agents with heterogeneous capabilities to work
            together by following a leader-follower type of interaction. However, the associated control
            problem becomes challenging when the leader agent does not have complete information about
            follower agents. There is a need for learning and adaptation of cooperation plans. To this
            end, we develop a meta-learning-based Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to address the
            challenges in the guided cooperative control for linear systems. We first formulate the guided
            cooperation between agents as a dynamic Stackelberg game and use the feedback Stackelberg
            equilibrium as the agent-wise cooperation strategy. We further leverage meta-learning to address
            the incomplete information of follower agents, where the leader agent learns a meta-response
            model from a prescribed set of followers offline and adapts to a new coming cooperation task
            with a small amount of learning data. We use a case study in robot teaming to corroborate the
            effectiveness of our framework. Comparison with other learning approaches also shows that our
            learned cooperation strategy provides better transferability for different cooperation tasks.

            In this study, we explore the application of game theory, in particular Stackelberg games, to address the issue of effective coordination strategy generation for heterogeneous robots with one-way communication. To that end, focusing on the task of multi-object rearrangement, we develop a theoretical and algorithmic framework that provides strategic guidance for a pair of robot arms, a leader and a follower where the leader has a model of the follower's decision-making process, through the computation of a feedback Stackelberg equilibrium. With built-in tolerance of model uncertainty, the strategic guidance generated by our planning algorithm not only improves the overall efficiency in solving the rearrangement tasks, but is also robust to common pitfalls in collaboration, e.g., chattering.

            Coverage services provided by LEO satellite constellations have served as the base platform for various space applications. However, the surge of space attacks such as physical and cyber attacks are greatly endangering the security of satellite constellations and the integrity of the coverage services. As repairs of satellites are challenging, a distributed protection mechanism is necessary to ensure the self-healing of the satellite constellation coverage from different attacks. To this end, this paper establishes a distributed framework to empower a resilient satellite constellation coverage design and control within a single orbit. Each satellite can make decisions individually to recover from adversarial and non-adversarial attacks and keep providing coverage service. We first provide the average coverage cost to measure the coverage performance. Then, we formulate the joint resilient coverage planning-control problem as a two-stage problem by decoupling the coverage planning and fuel-optimal control. A distributed algorithm is proposed to find the optimal coverage configuration. The multi-waypoint MPC methodology is adopted to steer satellites to the target configuration. Finally, we use a typical LEO satellite constellation as a case study to corroborate the results.

            Multi-agent learning (MAL) studies how agents learn to behave optimally and adaptively from their experience when interacting with other agents in dynamic environments. 
            The outcome of a MAL process is jointly determined by all agents’ decision-making. Hence, each agent needs to think strategically about others’ sequential moves, 
            when planning future actions. The strategic interactions among agents makes MAL go beyond the direct extension of single-agent learning to multiple agents. 
            With the strategic thinking, each agent aims to build a subjective model of others decision-making using its observations. 
            Such modeling is directly influenced by agents’ perception during the learning process, which is called the information structure of the agent’s learning. 
            As it determines the input to MAL processes, information structures play a significant role in the learning mechanisms of the agents. 
            This review creates a taxonomy of MAL and establishes a unified and systematic way to understand MAL from the perspective of information structures. 
            We define three fundamental components of MAL: the information structure (i.e., what the agent can observe), 
            the belief generation (i.e., how the agent forms a belief about others based on the observations), 
            as well as the policy generation (i.e., how the agent generates its policy based on its belief). In addition, this taxonomy enables the classification of 
            a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms into four categories based on the belief-generation mechanisms of the opponents, including stationary, conjectured, calibrated, and sophisticated opponents. 
            We introduce Value of Information (VoI) as a metric to quantify the impact of different information structures on MAL. 
            Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of algorithms from different categories and point to promising avenues of future research.

            The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing interest in the modeling and analysis of infectious diseases. 
            The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. 
            In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolution of herd behaviors and epidemics. 
            Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. 
            The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. 
            Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players’ social activities. 
            We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. 
            The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. 
            We develop a structure-preserving approximation technique to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. 
            The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.

            The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing interest in the modeling and analysis of infectious diseases. 
            Our social behaviors in the daily lives have been significantly affected by the pandemic. 
            In this paper, we propose a federated evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupling of herd behaviors changes and epidemics spreading. 
            Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by integrating it with the evolutionary game dynamics. 
            The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. 
            Meanwhile, the spread of infectious diseases over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. 
            We address the challenge of federated dynamics by breaking the analysis into the studies of the stationary properties of the epidemic for given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. 
            We use numerical experiments to show that our framework enables the prediction of the historical COVID-19 statistics.

            The recent surge in ransomware attacks has threatened many critical infrastructures such as oil pipeline systems, hospitals, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT). 
            Ransomware is a cryptoviral extortion attack that involves two phases: the cyber infection of the malware and the financial transaction of the ransom payment. 
            As the ransomware attackers are financially motivated, the protection of the infrastructure networked systems requires a cross-layer risk analysis that not only examines the vulnerability of the cyber system but also consolidates the economics of ransom payment. 
            To this end, this paper establishes a two-player multi-phase and multi-stage game framework to model cyber and economic phases of a ransomware attack. 
            We use a zero-sum Markov game to capture the multi-stage penetration of ransomware in the lateral movement. A sequential-move game is proposed to model the ransom payment interactions at the second phase. 
            Two games are composed to form a multi-phase and multi-stage game-in-games (MPMS-GiG) that enables a holistic risk assessment of ransomware in networks and a cross-layer design of cyber defense and investment strategies to mitigate the attack. 
            We provide a complete equilibrium characterization of ransomware game and design interdependent optimal strategies for cyber protection and ransom payment. 
            We use prospect theory to analyze the impact of human factors on equilibrium strategies. Finally, we use a prototypical industrial IoT network as a case study to corroborate the results.

            Counterfeiting has been a pervasive threat to the security of supply chains. With the development of cyber technologies, traditional supply chains move their logistics to the cyberspace for better efficiency. 
            However, counterfeiting threats still exist and may even cause worse consequences. It is imperative to find mitigating strategies to combat counterfeiting in the cyber supply chain. 
            In this paper, we establish a games-in-games framework to capture the interactions of counterfeiting activities in the cyber supply chain. 
            Specifically, the sellers in the cyber supply chain play a Stackelberg game with consumers, while sellers compete with each other by playing a Nash game. 
            All sellers and consumers aim to maximize their utilities. We design algorithms to find the best response of all participants and analyze the equilibrium of the supply chain system. 
            Finally, we use case studies to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior and propose effective anti-counterfeit strategies.

            LEO satellite constellation coverage has served as the base platform for various space applications. 
            However, the rapidly evolving security environment such as orbit debris and adversarial space threats are greatly endangering the security of satellite constellation and integrity of the satellite constellation coverage. 
            As on-orbit repairs are challenging, a distributed and autonomous protection mechanism is necessary to ensure the adaptation and self-healing of the satellite constellation coverage from different attacks. 
            To this end, we establish an integrative and distributed framework to enable resilient satellite constellation coverage planning and control in a single orbit. 
            Each satellite can make decisions individually to recover from adversarial and non-adversarial attacks and keep providing coverage service. We first provide models and methodologies to measure the coverage performance. 
            Then, we formulate the joint resilient coverage planning-control problem as a two-stage problem. A coverage game is proposed to find the equilibrium constellation deployment for resilient coverage planning and an agent-based algorithm is developed to compute the equilibrium. 
            The multi-waypoint Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology is adopted to achieve autonomous self-healing control. Finally, we use a typical LEO satellite constellation as a case study to corroborate the results.

            Resilience describes a system's ability to function under disturbances and threats. Many critical infrastructures, including smart grids and transportation networks, are large-scale complex systems consisting of many interdependent subsystems. 
            Decentralized architecture becomes a key resilience design paradigm for large-scale systems. In this book chapter, we present a multi-agent system (MAS) framework for distributed large-scale control systems and discuss the role of MAS learning in resiliency. 
            This chapter introduces the creation of an artificial intelligence (AI) stack in the MAS to provide computational intelligence for subsystems to detect, respond, and recover. We discuss the application of learning methods at the cyber and physical layers of the system. 
            The discussions focus on distributed learning algorithms for subsystems to respond to each other, and game-theoretic learning for them to respond to disturbances and adversarial behaviors. The book chapter presents a case study of distributed renewable energy systems to elaborate on the MAS architecture and its interface with the AI stack.

            The wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy devices improves the quality of life, but simultaneously, it enlarges the attack surface of the power grid system. 
            The adversary can gain illegitimate control of a large number of these devices and use them as a means to compromise the physical grid operation, 
            a mechanism known as the IoT botnet attack. This paper aims to improve the resiliency of cyber-physical power grids to such attacks. 
            Specifically, we use an epidemic model to understand the dynamic botnet formation which facilitates the assessment of the cyber layer vulnerability of the grid. 
            The attacker aims to exploit this vulnerability to enable a successful physical compromise, while the system operator's goal is to ensure a normal operation of the grid by mitigating cyber risks. 
            We develop a cross-layer game-theoretic framework for strategic decision-making to enhance cyber-physical grid resiliency. The cyber-layer game guides the system operator on how to defend against the botnet attacker as the first layer of defense, 
            while the dynamic game strategy at the physical layer further counteracts the adversarial behavior in real-time for improved physical resilience. 
            A number of case studies on the IEEE-39 bus system are used to corroborate the devised approach.
